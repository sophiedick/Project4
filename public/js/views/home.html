<p class="quote">“The question of what you want to own is actually the question of how you want to live your life.”<br>
<em>― Marie Kondō, The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing</em></p><br><br>

<p class="intro">The notion that the more we have, the better our quality of life seems to be ingrained in our way of thinking. If you consider the time, energy, and money it takes to accumulate and maintain these things, you begin to see that having too much actually takes away from your 
quality of life.

For over 10 years, with a 'living better with less' philosophy, I've helped my clients to move from consuming unconsciously to consciously; to living for and with what they truly love and need. It's not just about being organized; it's a new way of seeing your things.

This approach is not only better for your space and for you spiritually; it's better for your wallet and even the planet.</p>
