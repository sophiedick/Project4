<h1>Testimonials</h1>

<p class="quote"><em>Working with Sophie was an absolute pleasure every step of the way. We hired Sophie to help decorate our newly renovated apartment, and from the very beginning he made such a great impression on us. From his work ethic and presentations to his detailed follow up emails, we knew we would be in great hands throughout the process.  Sophie was able to work within our budget (and even came in under-budget) to help us choose everything from picture frames to bedroom furniture to finishing touches in our kitchen and living room. His attention to detail is incredible and each decision was handled in the most professional manner. My husband and I both work, and we have twin girls, so life is very busy for us. Sophie was able to work within our family's parameters and make the process enjoyable, but at the same time always used his time and our time wisely. We cannot say enough about the quality of Sophie’s work and, because of her, our apartment truly feels like a home!</p>

<p class="quote">I was thrilled with the work Sophie did for us when we moved from one Manhattan apartment to another. He organized our kitchen so intelligently, it was a work of art. He also elegantly arranged my bookcases and desk. I was six months pregnant with twins at the time, and it was the greatest luxury to lie down on the sofa and watch Sophie work his magic. In addition to his knack for organization, he has a great sense of style. He is incredibly professional and a pleasure to be around.  It was the most satisfying check I'd ever written.</p>

<p class="quote">Who else could I trust to give the keys to my house, go on a business trip, and come home to a perfectly organized and beautiful new office? Sophie. He has a sixth sense when it comes to organizing: when I need to find something, I just go to where my instincts tell me and 99.9% of the time, there's that missing thing I've been looking for that Sophie perfectly placed.</p>

<p class="quote">I hired Sophie to help me make the transition to my new apartment with the hope that he could organize my life and create a sanctuary that I was happy to come home to. He not only met and exceeded those goals, he absolutely changed the way I live. He worked closely with me to understand my lifestyle, and he used that information to design and organize my ideal space. His absolute attention to detail coupled with his refreshing creativity and impeccable style manifested in an elegant and, more importantly, sustainable space. I never imagined that this lifestyle was attainable at this point in my life, but Sophie made it happen. I recommend her to anyone looking for a fresh start and a lifestyle makeover. I truly can’t say enough about Sophie and the positive impact his services have made in my life.</p>
