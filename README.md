General Assembly - Project Four: The Sort Club

The idea:

The notion that the more we have, the better our quality of life seems to be ingrained in our way of thinking. If you consider the time, energy, and money it takes to accumulate and maintain these things, you begin to see that having too much actually takes away from your quality of life. It's not just about being organized; it's a new way of seeing your things. This approach is not only better for your space and for you spiritually; it's better for your wallet and even the planet.

How to use the app:

Simply land on the homepage – from here you will be able to read about the concept of the business and also view the provided services. If you like what you see and wish to make a booking, you will need to  click on the navbar to either register or login – you are then formally invited to make a booking.
